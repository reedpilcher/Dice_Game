    Source 2 is where I learned how to simply loop the game over if the user wishes to play again.

    "Rules

    The game is quite simple. There are three dice used in the game. The guest picks one and afterwards the dealer choses one as well. Both players roll and whoever gets a higher number wins. The guest will receive double the amount bid. If he loses, the dealer will get the bettings. However the three dice have different numberings on them:

    The Black Dice has 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8
    The White Dice has 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 9
    The Red Dice has 2, 2, 6, 6, 7, 7

    Since the guest chose the die first, the host had the advantage of choosing the best option against the guest's option, with a five out of nine chances for the host to win."

    Inspired by a dice game played in the show "Kakegurui Twin", I am attempting to recreate the game in Java. In this version there is no betting, but the corrupt nature of the inspiration is still shown. In the show it's a school that revolves around gambling, and cheating whenever possible. In this game the "Host" or opponent alway picks second, giving them the upper hand. The numbers on the dice are rigged much like rock, paper, scissors. Each dice beats another one in terms of probability and by knowing which dice to pick puts the odds in your favor. Although it isn't a fair game that is based solely on probability, I had fun implementing a recreation of a gambling game from the show into a functional Java program. I may add a betting implemenation in the future to make it more accurate.

    Have fun playing, but don't get mad if you lose more often than not!
